Yo! This is a small project where I tried to do the object detection on my image and videos using Darknet. I got the class probability in the file named "meeee.txt" that tells about the class probabilities. In meeee.txt, the first one is a simple serial number corresponding to classes.txt and the other four values are x,y,w,and h. The image that is used is meeee.jpg. "classes.txt" shows the number of classes identified by the Darknet in the meeee.jpg image. There are various other pics which I have tested such as eagle, person, and one of my coffee stirring video. All those pics and videos are available on my gdrive. You can check YOLOv4_OD_using_DN.ipynb file to get the idea of the code.
