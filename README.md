Yo! This is a small project where I tried to do the object detection on my image and videos using Darknet. I got the class probability in the file named "classes.txt" that tells about the class probabilities. In classes.txt, the first one is a simple number corresponding to meeee.txt and the other four values are x,y,w,and h. The image that is used is meeee.jpg. There are various other pics which I have tested such as eagle, person, and one of my coffee stirring video. All those pics and videos are available on my gdrive. You can check YOLOv4_OD_using_DN.ipynb file to get the idea of the code.
